            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>I am recreating Paco Rabanne’s iconic metallic disc dress using cardboard discs of various shapes and sizes.<br>
              This product is intended to be displayed rather than worn.<br>
              In my materials research, I was limited by available materials and cost. I decided to use cardboard as the primary material because it is easy to access and I can recycle the materials.<br>
              <br>
              Throughout the quarter, I used simple shapes to create screen block pattern designs from mid-century design and architecture. When I lasercut screen block patterns for assignments 1, 2, and 3, I was left with so many cut-out pieces (negative space on the pattern) that I didn’t want to throw away! I was reminded and inspired by Rabanne’s use of unconventional materials in design and want to create my own wearables inspired by the Spanish designer’s work.<br>

            <h3>Tasks</h3>
            • Modeling the chips/variations of the chips in Rhino and Grasshopper <br>
            • Lasercutting the dress chips <br>
            • 3D printing accessories <br>
             <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            • May 30-31: CAD modelling chips and variations <br>
            • June 1: laser cutting <br>
            • June 2: 3D printing <br>
            • June 3 - June 6: assembly, adjustments <br>
            • DUE: June 7 <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Bill of Materials</h3>
            Based off of research of old patterns to Rabanne’s dresses, I should have approximately 750 1” chips. This number is not exact, because I will have chips of various sizes and shapes.<br>
            I have already sourced materials except for the 3D printer filament. I will purchase filament if our shared supplies run low.<br>
