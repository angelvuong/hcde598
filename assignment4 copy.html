            This project is a departure from my screen block pattern theme. It was accomplished through designing shapes in OnShape and lasercutting.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 1. Planning</h3>
            <p>Switching to a new tool was very intimidating to me. I decided to create the simplest moving parts assembly that I could think of in order to understand the tool. First, I sketched and extruded a circle in OnShape to create a disc. I copied Joshua's linkage and fastener parts into my design to see if I could recreate how the parts could assemble with my new disc.<br>
            I added variables to adjust the diameter of the pin (6.35mm) and depth of the material (3.12mm). Should I decide to work with other materials, the variables will enable me to make easy size adjustments.<br>
            The disc has a diameter of 75 mm.

            <h3>Step 2. Lasercutting</h3>
            First, I did a test cut of the design on 3mm plywood (Speed 10, Power 100). The cleanly cut pieces assembled easily with plastic fasteners.<br>

            Next, I used the lasercutter to cut delrin (Speed 7, Power 100).

            <br>
            <h3>Step 3. Assembly</h3>
            Laser cutting was a success, so assembly was quite easy and satisfying. I connected the discs to the linkages with the plastic fasteners that Joshua provided in class. The enjoyable *snap* from assembling pieces together sparked much joy.<br>

            Collaborators:<br>
            Andrew Waer - Helped tremendously by reviewing OnShape with me. He also gave me plywood to test cut on!<br>
            Joshua Vasquez - I used Joshua's linkage part and fasteners in my design. I also used some of his delrin!<br>
            Joyce Lu - Helped me with OnShape scaling issues!<br>
