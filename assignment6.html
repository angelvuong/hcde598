            I learned molding and casting for this week's assignment. The goal of this project was to design and fabricate a silicone mold and to create four identical casts. I was excited to return back to my screen block theme and to create my own tiny screen blocks out of plaster! For this assignment I casted blocks in the "Vista Vue" pattern. <br><br>
            Materials and Tools: <br>
            Rhino<br>
            3D printed mold<br>
            OOMOO 30 Silicone Mold Rubber<br>
            Plaster of Paris<br>
            Lots of paper towels, mixing containers, and cleaning supplies<br>
            <br>

            <h3>Step 1. Designing the Mold</h3>
            <p>I designed my mold-mold in Rhino to be 3D printed. When we were assigned this project, I thought that I would mill out my design in wax. I learned from classmates that 3D printing was an easier way to go about doing this project since there were a lot of hiccups encountered with cutting the wax down to size/milling times.
              First, I modeled a "Vista Vue" block pattern (flat shapes, extruded) then I added it into a 2x2" box shape in Rhino.<br>

             <br>
            Next, I exported my design as an STL file to be 3D printed. <br>
              <br>
            <h3>Step 2. 3D Printing</h3>
            I set up the printers to 230Â°F and set up printing settings in the Dremel Slicer. I set the infill at 20% and printing was straightforward. The print time was roughly 8 hours, and the first few layers of printing appeared to be successful, so I left the printer to do its work overnight. (This is why I love 3D printing!)<br>

            <br>
            I returned the following day to pick up my mold. I was impressed by how it turned out (exactly as I wanted it to), considering I encountered many printing troubles on the third assignment.<br>

            <h3>Step 3. Silicone Molding</h3>
            Follwing the package instructions for OOMOO 30, I mixed the two liquids together at a 1:1 ratio. I poured the combined mixture into my 3D printed mold (up to the brim) and allowed it to set overnight. Removing the silicone mold from the printed mold was very challenging! I wanted to be gentle with the mold because I worried that the inner parts would rip out. I tried prying the mold free with a butter knife and eventually got it out by pulling, prodding, pushing, and *not* ripping out the inner parts. Since I had plenty of leftover OOMOO, I also created a second mold.<br>

            <br>
            <h3>Step 4. Plaster Casting</h3>
            To create my plaster block, I mixed Plaster of Paris at a 2:1 (powder to water) ratio and poured it into my two silicone molds. I left the plaster to set for one hour. I was worried about removing the plaster from the mold and feared that the inner parts would get stuck/rip out/crumble, but the blocks came out very easily! Success! Overall, the end-to-end process was easy but time-consuming. I really enjoyed creating my own blocks and hope to revist this project in the future to create more block patterns. Since I have more than half of the box of plaster mix left, I plan to use it all up by casting as many blocks as I can. I plan to gift the blocks to my architecture friends.<br>
