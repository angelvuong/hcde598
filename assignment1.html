            I created a press kit inspired by concrete breeze block screens that were popularized in American
            mid-century architecture. <br><br>
            Collaborators:<br>
            Connor Stein, M Arch - Thank you for the time you spent helping me learn Rhino and for letting me use your scrap cardboard! <br>
            Liang He, CS PhD - Thank you for showing me MakerCase! <br><br>

            <h3>Iteration 1-4</h3>
            <p>I started this project by designing a block layout in Illustrator. I used a template that I generated in MakerCase. I was inspired by the "Empress" breeze block pattern and incorporated it into my design by creating simple shapes in Illustrator.<br>
<!-- <br> -->
              <b>Iteration 1</b> (13% power, 9% speed) my first iteration turned out well! Connected with finger slots, the box stood on its own but collapsed with gentle shaking. I used E-Flute cardboard.<br>
              <b>Iteration 2</b> (14% power,9% speed) I attempted to decrease the size of notches for a tighter fit but the pieces would not fit together. <br>
              <b>Iteration 3</b> (25% power, 10% speed) used T-slot connectors but could not stand on its own and frequently collapsed. The increase in power resulted in burned edges!<br>
              <b>Iteration 4</b> (25% power, 10% speed) Tested with C-flute cardboard and did not like the bulky look of the cuts.
              <br>
            <h3>Iteration 5-9</h3>
            Rhino was a gamechanger for the later prototypes. I went in a different direction by making components that slot together. After sketching out ideas of the design, I created my design for a square face and key in Rhino. (With lots of help from Connor!)
            <br>
            <b>Iteration 5</b> (15% power, 7% speed) The slower speed ensured that my E-Flute cardboard was completely cut through. The notches on the square and key were .5" long and .073" wide. When the pieces were put together, it was too loose and the key overlapped the Empress pattern. This meant that I had to decrease the slot lengths and widths.<br>
            <b>Iteration 6</b> (15% power, 7% speed) .375" long slots and .07" wide, tightened to allow the key to wedge into the square face. Turns out it was still too loose! <br>
            <b>Iteration 7</b> (15% power, 7% speed) .375" long slots and .058" wide. SO CLOSE... The slots were tighter but the components would have come apart if given a light shake. <br>
            <b>Iteration 8</b> (15% power, 7% speed) .375" long slots and .05" wide. Perfect! After a successful prototype, I proceeded to print 15 faces and many keys, knowing that they might get damaged or bent in the assembly phase.
