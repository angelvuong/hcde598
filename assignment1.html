            I created a press kit inspired by concrete breeze block screens that were popularized in American
            mid-century architecture. <br><br>
            Collaborators:<br>
            Connor Stein, M Arch - Thank you for the time you spent helping me learn Rhino and for letting me use your scrap cardboard! <br>
            Liang He, CS PhD - Thank you for showing me MakerCase! <br><br>

            <h3>Iteration 1-4</h3>
            <p>I started this project by designing a block layout in Illustrator. I used a template that I generated in MakerCase. I was inspired by the "Empress" breeze block pattern and incorporated it into my design by creating simple shapes in Illustrator.
              Iteration 1 (13% power, 9% speed) my first iteration turned out well! Connected with finger slots, the box stood on its own but collapsed with gentle shaking. I used E-Flute cardboard.<br>
              Iteration 2 (14% power,9% speed) I attempted to decrease the size of notches for a tighter fit but the pieces would not fit together. <br>
              Iteration 3 (25% power, 10% speed) used T-slot connectors but could not stand on its own and frequently collapsed. <br>
              Iteration 4 (25% power, 10% speed) Tested with C-flute cardboard and did not like the bulky look of the cuts.
              <br>
            <h3>Iteration 5-9</h3>
            Rhino was a gamechanger for the later prototypes.
